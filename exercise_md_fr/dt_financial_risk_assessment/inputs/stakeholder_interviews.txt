* Key metrics needed: false positive rates, risk distribution across portfolio, emerging risk patterns
* Current pain point: Lack of unified view across different risk types (credit, fraud, AML)
* "We're seeing 85% false positive rates in our current system, which is unsustainable from a review cost perspective."
* Needs ability to show regulators how ML decisions are made (explainability requirement)
* Critical project success criteria: 50% reduction in false positives while maintaining or improving risk detection

### Michael Rodriguez, Chief Technology Officer
* Preference for cloud-native architecture on AWS (already have enterprise agreement)
* Concerns about data security and privacy requirements (GDPR, CCPA compliance)
* System must integrate with existing data warehouse and customer systems
* Performance requirements: real-time decisioning (<300ms for fraud, <2s for AML checks)
* Scalability concerns: "We need to handle 10x current transaction volume within 3 years."
* Legacy system integration challenges: "Many of our core banking systems are from the 1990s."
* Wants phased implementation approach, starting with fraud models then AML
* Concerned about: "How will we maintain and retrain these models over time?"

### David Park, Chief Financial Officer

## TECHNICAL STAKEHOLDERS

### Amit Patel, Data Science Lead
* Current models use XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms
* Challenge with imbalanced datasets (fraud cases <0.1% of transactions)
* Data quality issues, especially with merchant categorization
* Preference for Python-based modeling environment
* "Our current feature engineering process is too manual and time-consuming."
* Needs automated model monitoring and performance tracking
* Concerned about concept drift in behavioral models
* Interested in incorporating network analysis for connected accounts

### Jane Martinez, Security Architect
* Data encryption requirements: PCI-DSS and internal security policies
* Access control needs: Role-based access with fine-grained permissions
* API security concerns for external integrations
* Sensitive data handling policies must be enforced
* "We need comprehensive logging of all data access for security audits."
* Wants security scanning integrated into CI/CD pipeline
* Concerned about potential data leakage in model features
* Requirement: All PII must be tokenized in the analytics environment

### Omar Hassan, Integration Specialist
* Current systems use mixture of REST APIs and legacy file transfers
* Core banking system integration through IBM MQ
* Data latency issues with current batch processes
* "We need to transition from overnight batch to real-time where possible."
* API rate limiting concerns for high-volume endpoints
* Current challenge: Inconsistent customer identifiers across systems
* ETL processes need redesign for faster data availability
* Prefers gradual migration approach to minimize disruption

## END USERS

### Rachel Wong, Senior Fraud Analyst
* Daily workflow involves reviewing 40-50 alerts per day
* Main pain point: Limited context available when investigating alerts
* "I often have to access 5-6 different systems to investigate one case."
* Needs better visualization of transaction patterns and customer behavior
* Feature request: The ability to see similar past cases when reviewing an alert
* Current tools lack customer behavior history
* Would value automated information gathering to speed investigation
* Suggestion: "Can we highlight the specific factors that triggered the alert?"

### Marcus Johnson, AML Investigator
* Complex investigations can take several days to complete
* Documentation requirements are extensive for regulatory compliance
* "We need better tools to identify connected accounts and entities."
* Current system doesn't capture relationship networks effectively
* Challenge: Determining source of funds for high-value transactions
* Needs access to external data sources for entity verification
* Improved case management workflow would save significant time
* Request: "Can machine learning help identify subtle patterns in transaction behavior?"

### Patricia Garcia, Risk Analyst
* Responsible for adjusting risk thresholds and rules
* "It takes too long to implement and test rule changes."
* Needs better tools to measure the impact of rule adjustments
* Currently uses spreadsheets for rule performance tracking
* Wants ability to A/B test rule changes on a sample of transactions
* Challenge: Seasonal patterns require regular rule adjustments
* Feature request: Simulation environment to test rule changes against historical data
* "We need to balance risk control with business growth objectives."

4. Comprehensive audit trails and model explainability for regulatory compliance
5. Flexible rule configuration capabilities for business users
6. Unified view across different risk types (fraud, AML, credit)
7. Advanced analytics including behavioral profiling and network analysis
8. Case management workflow improvements for investigation efficiency
9. Secure handling of sensitive data with appropriate access controls
10. Scalable architecture to support growing transaction volumes
11. Model monitoring and maintenance capabilities for long-term sustainability

## ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

The current risk management infrastructure is fragmented across multiple systems:
- TransactionShield (fraud detection system) - implemented in 2018
- ComplianceGuard (AML monitoring system) - implemented in 2012
- CreditSafe (credit risk system) - implemented in 2015

None of these systems effectively communicate with each other, creating data silos and inconsistent risk assessments. The business case for the new FinSecure Platform is built on improved risk detection through unified data and advanced analytics, as well as operational efficiency gains through workflow automation and alert prioritization.

Executive sponsors have emphasized that this project is strategically important for the organization's digital transformation initiative and future regulatory compliance capabilities.
